# Sumary

The purpose for this project was to figure out whether or not NYC shutdown for non-essential workers affected the rate of crime/arrests. Hypothesis was made that there would be a drop in NYPD arrests during the months NYC was under quarantine due to COVID-19 and there would be a shift in what crimes became more common.
