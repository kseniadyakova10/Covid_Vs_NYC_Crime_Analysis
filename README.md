### Summary 
The focus of our project is to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime rates in New York City. Using public crime data, we analyzed trends to determine which types of crimes became more common due to the shutdown and which types of crimes became less common based on YOY trends. We broke down trends based on crime type and determined if we wanted to analyze the trends across the boroughs on NYC or focus on a specific borough or neighborhood within the borough. 

### Specific Questions 
1. What specific crimes have increased 
2. What specific crimes have decreased 
3. Is the crime rate higher or lower? 
4. How do the trends vary by age range?
