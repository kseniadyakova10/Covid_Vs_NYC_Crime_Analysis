### Summary 
The focus of the project is to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime rates in New York City. Using public crime data, we analyzed trends to determine which types of crimes became more common due to the shutdown and which types of crimes became less common based on YOY trends.

### Specific Questions 
1. What specific crimes have increased 
2. What specific crimes have decreased 
3. Is the crime rate higher or lower? 
4. How do the trends vary by age range? 

### Datasets to explore:

### Data Cleanup 
Three biggest files we worked with were NYPD Arrest Data Year to Date(2019 extraction),NYPD Arrest Data Historic(2020 extraction) and NYPD Hospitalization Counts. Since we only needed two specific years, we were able to extract those years and work with much smaller files for our analysis.
